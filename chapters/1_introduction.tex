\chapter{Introduction}
The coursework assignment task is to write a graphics program using WebGL and GLSL. I decided to take a more creative approach to this coursework, opting to stay away from the example cubes game and veering towards a more storyline-based game - we'll explore this more later in the report.

\section{Project summary}
We develop a \texttt{three.js} exploration game called "Station Epsilon-7: Dark Signal", where the player is a safety inspector investigating an Arctic research station where communications ceased. The project is modular JavaScript with Vite as the build tool, and \texttt{three.js} as the sole runtime dependency.

The entry point of the program is \texttt{src/main.js}, and it follows (vaguely) a centralized manager-type architecture.
